#### Creators: 
##### Shira Turgeman & Noa Elishmereni & Dorin Domin
#####  [our GitHub](https://github.com/shiraTurgeman/cookids_app)

### **Basic information**
* We wanted to build an app that would be useful and help people. the idea arose of encouraging children and people with disabilities to become independent through the development of cooking skills. We decided to develop the theme and adapt the app for small children as well, among other things in order to provide employment for quality time of parents with their children at home during the Corona period and in general.

* The goal is to encourage people with disabilities and young children to learn hoe to cook, while achiveing confidence and independence. The app is intended for users with low motor ability who are able to perform actions themselves but need adult supervision.
The goal is to illustrate the cooking visually, step by step, to give the user the option to move on to the next step in the recipe after completing the previous step successfully while giving feedback.

### **Environment and tools**
* we build this app on Andtoid Studio, while using Flutter. 
* Tools we used:
  * Flutter
  * Python
  * Android Stodio


  * Tensorflow, OpenCV (Real Time Object Detection)
  * 
  * MongoDB (saving our database)
